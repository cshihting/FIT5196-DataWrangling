The core mandate of UNHCR is the international protection of refugees. The provision of international protection by UNHCR implies ensuring the basic human rights of refugees in their countries of asylum and that refugees will not be returned involuntarily to a country where they could face persecution. Longer term, the organization helps refugees find appropriate durable solutions to their plight, by repatriating voluntarily to their homeland, integrating in countries of asylum or resettling in third countries. UNHCR has presence in the Republic of Armenia since 1992, under a Co-operation Agreement signed with the Government. UNHCRs work in Armenia presently concentrates on capacity-building activities geared towards strengthening national authorities, laws and policies to ensure the proper handling of refugee and asylum issues, the reception and care of refugees, the promotion of self-reliance of refugees and the realization of durable solutions.  These are carried out in combination with other activities such as advocacy, information dissemination and monitoring. In 2012, UNHCR Armenia will pursue three overarching goals in co-operation with its governmental and NGO partners: - Ensureing effective protection of refugees and asylum-seekers; - Promoteing the integration of refugees; - Addressing statelessness.

      "                        \"OSCE Aarhus Centres Initiative serves as a practical tool for advancing implementation of the Aarhus Convention and its principles in everyday life. Aarhus Centres act as mediators between civil society organizations and government agencies as well as business sector. Aarhus Centres are actively engaged in creating public awareness, disseminating environmental information, organizing public hearings, organizing trainings for NGOs and communities, providing legal advice to citizens on their environmental rights. They are also empowering civil society through increased understanding of environment and security linkages and mobilizing their attention to the priority environment and security challenges. Currently there are 15 Aarhus Centres operating in Armenia promoting principles of good environmental governance though disseminating environmental information, creating environmental awareness and organizing public hearings on draft legislation, policy and programme documents and projects of the Government that might have implications on environment. Despite the progress made during the last years in environmental governance, some needs and challenges still remain. Analytical reports and experience on the ground, point to the necessity of further improvements of legislation, creation of well-established mechanisms for participation and capacity building activities. The objective of the project on Aarhus Centres in the South Caucasus is to promote transparency of environmental information, participatory governance and access to justice through Aarhus Centres operating in the South Caucasus.  One of the project activities focuses on proving legal analysis of environmental legislation to the public from the Aarhus Convention perspective. In Armenia activity will focus on conducting the analysis on implementation of environmental rights/ legislation in direct relation to the law enforcement practice and participatory processes involving all stakeholders at the national and local levels. Special attention will be paid to community rights, public participation, on procedures and rules. In this regard the OSCE Office in Yerevan invites applications from highly qualified, energetic and experienced Armenian professionals to perform services of an experienced Expert on Environmental Impact Assessment and Procedural Rights. The post duration is limited to 6 months of total full time service. \"\n",

We support programmes that help women, men and young people: - plan their families and avoid unwanted pregnancies;  - undergo pregnancy and childbirth safely;  - avoid sexually transmitted infections(STIs) - including HIV/AIDS;  - combat violence against women. Together, these elements promote reproductive health - a state of complete physical, mental and social well being in all matters related to the reproductive system. Reproductive health is recognized as a human right, part of the right to health. UNFPA also helps governments in the world's poorest countries, and in other countries in need, to formulate population policies and strategies to ensure that economic and social development frameworks and programmes take account of population dynamics, namely, of aging, fertility, migration, and gender. All UNFPA-funded programmes promote women's equality. UNFPA works to raise awareness of these needs among people everywhere.
